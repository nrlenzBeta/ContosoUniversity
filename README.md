Contoso University

This is the first in a series of tutorials that show how to use Entity Framework (EF) Core in an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages app. The tutorials build a web site for a fictional Contoso University. The site includes functionality such as student admission, course creation, and instructor assignments. The tutorial uses the code first approach. For information on following this tutorial using the database first approach, see this Github issue.
